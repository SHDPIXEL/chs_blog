I'll create a new preview page for blogs that allows admins and authors to preview their blogs before publishing. This preview page will ensure that authors can only preview their own blogs or blogs where they are co-authors.

First, let's create an API endpoint to get a blog's details for preview:


Opened server/routes.ts
Now, let's add a new API endpoint for previewing a blog post (where only the author or admin can access it):

Let's search for the public article endpoint to ensure we add our preview endpoint correctly:


Searched for "Find the public article endpoint in routes.ts"
Let's find the more specific article details endpoint:


Searched for "Find the article details endpoint in routes.ts"
Now let's find where the "Get public article by ID" endpoint is defined:


Opened server/routes.ts
Now let's add our preview endpoint:


Edited server/routes.ts
Now let's create the blog preview page component for the frontend:

Let's create the preview directory first:


Executed mkdir -p client/src/pages/preview
Now let's create the BlogPreview.tsx file:


Created client/src/pages/preview/BlogPreview.tsx
Now we need to add the new route to the App.tsx file:


Opened client/src/App.tsx
I've analyzed the recent progress on the CHC blog system. Here's where we stand:

✓ Fixed error handling for "body stream already read" errors
✓ Improved server and client error logging
✓ Added better response handling for bulk operations
✓ Created new preview endpoint API for articles

I'm currently creating a blog preview page that will allow admins and authors to preview their blog posts before publishing. I'll continue implementing this feature by:

Creating the preview component
Adding the route to App.tsx
Adding links from blog management pages

Restarted Start application
I see the server is currently having an issue with the port already being in use. Let me restart the workflow correctly to continue implementing the blog preview functionality:


Executed pkill -f "node.*server/index.ts" || true
Now let's restart the server correctly:


Restarted Start application
Now let's update the App.tsx file to add our new BlogPreview page:


Edited client/src/App.tsx
Now let's add the route for the blog preview page:


Edited client/src/App.tsx
Now, let's update the ProtectedRoute component to support the 'any' role option:


Opened client/src/lib/protected-route.tsx
Let's update the ProtectedRoute component to support the 'any' role option:


Edited client/src/lib/protected-route.tsx
Now let's update the ProtectedRoute component logic to handle the 'any' role case:


Edited client/src/lib/protected-route.tsx
Now, let's fix the LSP errors in the BlogPreview.tsx file:


Edited client/src/pages/preview/BlogPreview.tsx
Let's fix the remaining TypeScript issues in the BlogPreview component:


Edited client/src/pages/preview/BlogPreview.tsx
Let's fix the co-author type in the BlogPreview component:


Edited client/src/pages/preview/BlogPreview.tsx
I'm analyzing your progress on the CHC blog system rebranding and SEO implementation...

Looking at the recent work:
✓ Created BlogPreview.tsx component with proper types
✓ Added preview route to App.tsx
✓ Updated ProtectedRoute to support "any" role option
→ Implementing preview functionality for unpublished content

I'm making good progress implementing the preview functionality that allows both admins and authors to view unpublished content. I'll continue with implementing the server-side endpoint for previews and complete the preview page functionality.
