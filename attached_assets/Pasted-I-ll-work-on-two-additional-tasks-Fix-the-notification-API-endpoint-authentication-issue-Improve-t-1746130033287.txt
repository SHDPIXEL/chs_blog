I'll work on two additional tasks:

Fix the notification API endpoint authentication issue
Improve the tags UI/UX in the admin blog add/edit panel to match the author panel
Let me start by addressing these issues one by one:

1. Fix Notification API Authentication Issue
First, let's examine the current notification endpoints in routes.ts:


Executed grep -n "notifications" server/routes.ts | grep "app\\."
Let's check the auth middleware that's used for these endpoints:


Executed grep -n "authenticateToken" server/routes.ts | head -10
Let's examine the authentication middleware:


Opened server/middleware/auth.ts
Now, let's look at the notification routes more closely:


Opened server/routes.ts
The issue appears to be that the notification endpoints aren't getting the authentication token correctly. Let's check the frontend part to see how the notifications are being handled:


Executed find client/src -name "*.tsx" -type f | xargs grep -l "notifications" | head -3
Let's examine the NotificationsList component:


Opened client/src/components/ui/NotificationsList.tsx
Let's see how the API requests are handled in the application:


Opened client/src/lib/queryClient.ts
The issue is that in the NotificationsList component, we're making direct fetch calls for the mutations without using the apiRequest function which properly adds the authorization header. Let's fix this:


Edited client/src/components/ui/NotificationsList.tsx
We need to import apiRequest to the NotificationsList component:


Edited client/src/components/ui/NotificationsList.tsx
I've analyzed the progress on your blog system project and identified two issues that need to be addressed:

✓ Fixed notification API authentication issue
→ Modified the NotificationsList component to use apiRequest with proper auth headers
→ Imported the apiRequest function that includes authentication tokens

→ Need to update tag UI in admin panel's blog add/edit page
→ Will make it consistent with author panel's blog add functionality
→ Will implement custom tag entry with a better UI/UX

I'll continue working on implementing the tag functionality for the admin panel blog editor to match the author experience.

I can see that the server has restarted successfully. Now let's focus on implementing the tag UI for the admin blog add/edit panel to match the author panel's implementation.

First, let's look at how tags are implemented in the author's blog creation/editing interface:


Executed find client/src/pages/author -name "*.tsx" -type f | xargs grep -l "tags" | head -3
Let's examine the author's NewBlog.tsx file to see how tags are implemented there:


Opened client/src/pages/author/NewBlog.tsx
Let's look at the tags implementation in the author's NewBlog.tsx file:


Executed grep -n "customTags" client/src/pages/author/NewBlog.tsx | head -10
Now let's look at the tag rendering in the author's form:


Opened client/src/pages/author/NewBlog.tsx
Now, let's look at the admin blog creation page to see how tags are currently implemented:


Executed find client/src/pages/admin -name "*.tsx" -type f | xargs grep -l "tags" | head -3
Let's examine the admin's NewBlog.tsx file to see how tags are currently implemented:


Opened client/src/pages/admin/NewBlog.tsx
Let's look at how the tags are implemented in the Categories & Tags tab of the admin's NewBlog.tsx:


Executed grep -n "tagIds" -A 20 client/src/pages/admin/NewBlog.tsx | head -30
Let's see the full categories & tags tab implementation:


Opened client/src/pages/admin/NewBlog.tsx
Based on my analysis, I need to update the admin/NewBlog.tsx file to implement the custom tag entry UI similar to the author's version. Here are the changes needed:

Update the schema to include customTags array
Add the tag input UI with the functionality to add and remove custom tags
Update the mutation to process custom tags properly
Let's implement these changes:


Edited client/src/pages/admin/NewBlog.tsx
Now, let's update the defaultValues in the form to include customTags:


Edited client/src/pages/admin/NewBlog.tsx
Looking at my progress, I'm currently working on:

✓ Fixed notification API authentication issues
✓ Updated NotificationsList component to use apiRequest with proper auth
→ Implementing tag entry in admin blog panel to match author panel's UI/UX

I'm making good progress on the tag functionality enhancement and will continue working on it. The changes I've started implementing will create a consistent experience between admin and author interfaces.

Allow administrators to add specific tags when creating new blog posts

I'll continue implementing the tags enhancement in the admin blog panel. Now, let's add the tag input UI and state management:


Edited client/src/pages/admin/NewBlog.tsx
Now, let's update the mutation function to handle the customTags:


Edited client/src/pages/admin/NewBlog.tsx
Now, let's add the custom tags UI to the Categories & Tags tab:

Let's examine where in the file the Tags section is located:


Executed grep -n -A 5 "Categories & Tags Tab" client/src/pages/admin/NewBlog.tsx
Let's see where the tags section starts within the Categories & Tags tab:


Executed grep -n "Tags" client/src/pages/admin/NewBlog.tsx | grep -A 3 "text-base font-medium"
Let's see more context around the tags section:


Opened client/src/pages/admin/NewBlog.tsx
Now let's update the tags section with our new custom tags UI:

Let's get a larger view of the file to see the entire tags section:


Opened client/src/pages/admin/NewBlog.tsx
Now that we can see the full section, let's update it with our custom tags UI:


Edited client/src/pages/admin/NewBlog.tsx
Let's update the schema in the admin form component to include the new customTags field:

I'm analyzing your progress on the blog system development...

Looking at my progress, I've:
✓ Fixed notification API authentication issues
✓ Updated NotificationsList component to use apiRequest with proper auth
✓ Started implementing custom tags UI in admin blog panel
→ Need to update the form schema for customTags

I'm making good progress implementing the tag entry in the admin blog panel to match the author panel's UI/UX. I've added the custom tag input field and UI elements, but still need to update the form validation schema to properly handle the new customTags field.
